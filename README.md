# Advent of Code 2022

This is the repository of my contribution to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/).

I chose to use Python (what a surprise).

## Python version
Some of the challenges do use *modern* Python features. I used Python 3.11 interpreter
but 3.10 should be fine. The most recent feature is `match case` added in Python 3.10.

## Requirements
This project does not have any requirements.

## Status
For different reasons, I gave up on day 11. That challenge requires math skills I didn't
have. I will take some time to get back on this.
